All of our Minnesota Ice data came from the [Minnesota DNR](https://www.dnr.state.mn.us/ice_out/index.html). All of the physical lake characteristics such as depth, came from the Minnesota [Geospatial Commons](https://gisdata.mn.gov/dataset/water-lake-bathymetry). In some instances we had to manually enter depth (or other lake characteristics) because it was not available through the Geospatial Commons. In these instances, we used the mnsentinellakes package through R to access DNR surveys. These surveys can also be found by using MN DNR's [Lake Finder Website](https://www.dnr.state.mn.us/lakefind/index.html). Finally, all the climatic variables used in the lake ice analysis were downloaded through NOAA's [Physical Sciences Laboratory Website](https://psl.noaa.gov/data/climateindices/).
